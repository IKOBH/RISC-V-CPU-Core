# Building a RISC-V CPU Core

## Description

Implementing the RISC-V core as described in the free mini-workshop, offered by by [Steve Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-hoover-a44b607/) of [Redwood EDA, LLC](https://redwoodeda.com), [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), and [RISC-V International](https://riscv.org). Using the Makerchip online integrated development environment (IDE), I've implemented everything from logic gates to a simple, but complete, RISC-V CPU core.

This course is available [in this repository](https://github.com/stevehoover/LF-Building-a-RISC-V-CPU-Core-Course/blob/main/course.md) as well as via the [EdX platform](https://www.edx.org/course/building-a-risc-v-cpu-core) (with a certification option). Thousands have registered and/or completed this course, [including Claude](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/steve-hoover-a44b607_aitl-verilog-activity-7110383796658520066-LGzp) (Anthropic's AI chatbot):
